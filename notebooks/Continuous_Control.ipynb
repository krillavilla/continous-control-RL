    "The trained agent successfully solves the Reacher environment, achieving an average score of at least +30 over 100 consecutive episodes. The agent uses a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm with carefully tuned hyperparameters to learn an effective policy for controlling the robotic arm.\n",
