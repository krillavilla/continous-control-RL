# Project Report: Continuous Control

## Learning Algorithm

For this project, I implemented the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve the Reacher environment (Option 1 - single agent). DDPG is an actor-critic, model-free algorithm that can operate in continuous action spaces.

### Algorithm Details

DDPG combines the following key components:

1. **Actor-Critic Architecture**:
   - **Actor Network**: Determines the best action for a given state
   - **Critic Network**: Evaluates the action by estimating the Q-value

2. **Experience Replay**: Stores and randomly samples experiences to break correlations between consecutive samples

3. **Target Networks**: Separate networks for stable learning that are updated softly

4. **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process**: Adds temporally correlated noise for better exploration in continuous action spaces

### Network Architectures

#### Actor Network
- Input Layer: State size (33)
- Hidden Layer 1: 400 units with ReLU activation and batch normalization
- Hidden Layer 2: 300 units with ReLU activation
- Output Layer: Action size (4) with tanh activation to bound actions between -1 and 1

#### Critic Network
- Input Layer: State size (33)
- Hidden Layer 1: 400 units with ReLU activation and batch normalization
- Hidden Layer 2: 300 units with ReLU activation (concatenated with actions after the first hidden layer)
- Output Layer: 1 unit (Q-value)

### Hyperparameters

The following hyperparameters were used for training:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Buffer Size | 1,000,000 | Replay buffer size |
| Batch Size | 128 | Minibatch size |
| Gamma | 0.99 | Discount factor |
| Tau | 0.001 | Soft update parameter for target networks |
| Learning Rate (Actor) | 0.0001 | Learning rate for the actor network |
| Learning Rate (Critic) | 0.001 | Learning rate for the critic network |
| Weight Decay | 0 | L2 weight decay for the critic |
| OU Noise Theta | 0.15 | Parameter for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise process |
| OU Noise Sigma | 0.2 | Parameter for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise process |

## Training Results

The agent was able to solve the environment (achieve an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes) in approximately 150 episodes. The training curve below shows the score progression over episodes:

The agent's performance improved steadily over time, with some fluctuations due to the exploration noise. After solving the environment, the agent continued to maintain high performance, demonstrating the stability of the learned policy.

## Ideas for Future Work

Several improvements could be made to enhance the agent's performance:

1. **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Instead of uniform sampling from the replay buffer, prioritize experiences based on their TD error magnitude. This would focus learning on the most informative transitions.

2. **Parameter Noise for Exploration**: Replace the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with parameter space noise for exploration, which can provide more consistent exploration throughout training.

3. **Distributional RL**: Implement a distributional critic that predicts the distribution of Q-values rather than just the expected value, which can lead to more robust learning.

4. **Multi-Agent Training**: Extend the implementation to Option 2 (20 agents) and leverage the parallel nature of the environment for faster and more stable learning.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conduct a systematic search for optimal hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization.

6. **Alternative Algorithms**: Implement and compare other continuous control algorithms such as Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC).

7. **Network Architecture Improvements**: Experiment with different network architectures, such as deeper networks or residual connections, to potentially improve learning efficiency.

By implementing these improvements, the agent could potentially learn faster, achieve higher scores, and generalize better to different environments.
